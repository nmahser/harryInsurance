- git clone https://github.com/nmahser/harryInsurance.git
- install node.js version 6.10.1 (can't check the exact command now)
- install metamask -> create an account -> change Main Net to Ropsten Network -> click on the ball shape next Network selection drop down menu
-> import account -> use the private key I sent it on Telegram
- Open terminal type npm install 
- Run npm run start:dev
- More likely you'll run into an error. Let me know how it goes
